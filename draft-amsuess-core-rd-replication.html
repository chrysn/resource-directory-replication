  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>Discovery of endpoints and resources in M2M applications over large networks is enabled by Resource Directories, but no special consideration has been given to how such directories can scale beyond what can be managed by a single device.</p>
<p>This document explores different ways in which Resource Directories can be scaled up from single network to enterprise and global scale. It does not attempt to standardize any of those methods, but only to demonstrate the feasibility of such extensions and to provide terminology and exploratory groundwork for later documents.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The following sections outline different reasons why a Resource Directory should be scaled beyond a singe device.  Not all of them will necessarily apply to all use cases, and not all solution approaches might be suitable for all goals.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#large-numbers-of-registrations" id="large-numbers-of-registrations">Large numbers of registrations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">Even at 1kB of link data per registration, modern server hardware can easily keep the data of millions of registrations in RAM simultaneously.  Thus, the mere size of registration data is not expected to be a factor that requires scaling to multiple nodes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">The traffic produced when millions of nodes with the default 24h lifetime amounts to dozens of exchanges per second, which is doable with equal ease at central network equipment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">However, if the directory has additional interaction with its registered nodes, for example because it provides proxying to registered endpoints, resources like file descriptors can be exhausted earlier, and the traffic load on the registration server grows with the traffic it is proxying for the endpoint.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#large-number-of-requests" id="large-number-of-requests">Large number of requests</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">Not all approaches to constrained restful communication use the Resource Directory only in the setup stage; some are might also utilize a Resource Directory in more day-to-day operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">@@@ get some numbers on how many requests a single RD can deal with</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> <a href="#redundancy" id="redundancy">Redundancy</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">With the RD as a central part of CoRE infrastructures, outages can affect a large number of users.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">A decentralized RD should be able to deal both with scheduled downtimes of hosts as well as unexpected outages of hosts or parts of the network, especially with network splits between the individual parts of the directory.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#approaches" id="approaches">Approaches</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">In this section, two independent chains of approaches are presented.  The &#8220;shared authority&#8221; approach (using anycast or DNS aliases), and proxy-based caching (in stages from using generic proxies to RD replication that only bears little resemblance to proxies).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">Elements from those chains can be mixed.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#shared-authority" id="shared-authority">Shared authority</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">With this approach, a single host and port (or &#8220;authority&#8221; component in the generic URI syntax) is used for all interactions with the RD.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">This can be implemented using a host name pointing to different IP addresses simultaneously or depending on the requester&#8217;s location, using IP anycast addresses or both.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">From the client&#8217;s or proxy&#8217;s point of view, all interaction happens with same Origin Server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">In this setup, the replication is hidden from the REST interactions, and takes place inside the RD server implementation or its database backend.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">Compared to the other approaches, this is more complex to set up when it involves managing anycast addresses: Running an IPv4 anycast network on Internet scale requires running an Autonomous System.  In either variation, all server instances are tightly coupled; they need shared administration and probably need to run the same software.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">The replication characteristics are laregly inherited from the underlying backend.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.7">As registering endpoints only store the URI constructed from the Location-Path option to their registration request, registration updates can end up at any instance of the server, though they are likely to reach the same one as before most of the time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.8">Spontaneous failure of individual nodes can interrupt endpoints&#8217; registrations in scenarious that do not use anycast addresses until the unusable addresses have left DNS caches.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> <a href="#plain-caching" id="plain-caching">Plain caching</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">Caching reverse proxies that are not particularly aware of a Resource Directory can be used to mitigate the effect of large numbers of requests on a single RD server.  In this approach, there exists a single central RD server instance, but proxies are placed in front of it to reduce its load.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">Caching is applicable only to the lookup interfaces; the POST request used in registration and renewal are not cacheable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">A prerequisite for successful caching is that fresh copies exist in the cache; this is likely to happen only if there are many alike requests to the Resource Directory.  The proxy can than serve cached copies, and might find it advantageous to observe frequent queries.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">The simplest way to set up such proxying is to have the proxies forward all requests to the central RD and to advertise only the proxies&#8217; addresses.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">Due to the discovery process of the RD, operators can also limit the proxies to the lookup interfaces and advertise the central server for registration purposes.  A sample exchange between a node and its 6LoWPAN border router could be:</p>
<pre>
Req: GET coap://[fe80::1]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*

Res: 2.05 Content
&lt;coap://central-rd.example.com/rd&gt;;rt="core.rd",
&lt;coap://europe3.proxy.rd.example.com/rd-lookup/res&gt;;rt="core.rd-lookup-res",
&lt;coap://europe3.proxy.rd.example.com/rd-lookup/ep&gt;;rt="core.rd-lookup-ep"
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.6">Special care should be taken when a reverse proxy is not accessed by the client under the same address as the origin server, as relative references change their meaning when served from there.  This can be ignored completely on the resource lookup interface (as long as the provenance extension is not used); ignoring it on the endpoint lookup interface gives the client &#8220;wrong&#8221; results, though that is likely to only matter to applications that use both the lookup and the registration interface, like Commissioning Tools could do.  Proxies can be configured to do content transcoding (cf. <a href="#RFC8075" class="xref">[RFC8075]</a> Section 6.5.2) to preserve the lookup responses&#8217; original meanings.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.7">This approach does not help at all with large numbers of registrations.  It can mitigate issues with large numbers of lookup requests, provided that many identical requests arrive at the proxy.  The effect on the redundancy goal is negligible: The proxy can provide lookup results only for as long as the cache is fresh during a central server outage, which is 60 seconds unless the RD server says otherwise.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.8">This approach can be run with off-the-shelf RD servers and proxies.  The only configuration required is for the proxy to have a forwarding address, and for the RD (or its announcer) tho know which lookup addresses to advertise.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> <a href="#rd-aware-caching" id="rd-aware-caching">RD-aware caching</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">Similar to the above, specialized proxies can be employed that are aware that their target is an RD lookup address.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">The &#8220;plain caching&#8221; approach is limited in that it requires a small set of lookups to be frequently performed.  A proxy that is aware that the address it is forwarding to is of the Resource Type &#8220;core.rd-lookup-*&#8221; can utilize knowledge of how an RD works to serve more specialized requests as well from fresh generic content.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.3">For example, assume that the proxy frequently receives requests of the shape</p>
<pre>
Req: GET /rd-lookup/res?rt=core.s&amp;rt=ex.temperature&amp;ex.building=8341&amp;title=X
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.4">for arbitrary values of X. Then it can use the following request to keep a fresh cache:</p>
<pre>
Req: GET coap://rd.example.com/rd-lookup/res?rt=core.s&amp;rt=ex.temperature&amp;ex.building=8341
Observe: 1
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.5">and from that serve filtered responses to individual requests.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.6">This method shares the advantages of plain caching, with reduced limitations but requiring specialized proxying software.  The software does not necessarily need more configuration: A general-purpose proxy is free to explore the origin server&#8217;s <samp>.well-known/core</samp> information, and can decide to enable RD optimizations after discovering that the frequently accesses resources are of resource type &#8220;core.rd-lookup-*&#8221;.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3.1">4.3.1.</a> <a href="#potential-for-improvement" id="potential-for-improvement">Potential for improvement</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.1">Observing a large lookup result is relatively inefficient as the complete document needs to be transferred when a change happens.  Serializations of web links that are suitable for expressing small deltas are expected to be developed for PATCH operations on registration resources.  If those formats are compatible with observation, they can be applied directly.  Otherwise, the proxy can try to establish a &#8220;push&#8221; dynamic link (<a href="#I-D.ietf-core-dynlink" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink]</a>) to receive continuous PATCH updates on its resource.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.2">The applicability of the RD-aware approach is further limited to query parameters of which the proxy knows that they are not subject to lookup filtering on other entities than the queried one.  In the example above, were the variable part the <samp>d</samp> attribute (of endpoints, as opposed to the <samp>title</samp> of resources), the proxy could not do the filtering on its own becaus it would not have the required information.  Even the above example does not allow for fully accurate replication, as the endpoint <em>might</em> register with a <samp>title</samp> endpoint attribute, even though no such attribute is specified right now.  It might be worth considering to be more explicit about filtering &#8220;up&#8221; and &#8220;down&#8221; in the hiearchy in the RD specification.  Also, annotating the links in the endpoint lookup with information about which registration they belong to would help the proxy keep all the data around to solve more complex queries.  The provenance extension is proposed for that purpose.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.3">In its extreme form, the proxy can observe the complete lookup resources of the Resource Directory.  It can then answer all queries on its own based on the continuously fresh state transferred in the observations.  That form requires the RD to support the provenance extension.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.4">For such proxies, it can be suitable to configure them to use stale cache values for extended periods of time when the RD becomes intermittently unavailable.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.4">4.4.</a> <a href="#distinct-registration-points" id="distinct-registration-points">Distinct registration points</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.1">Caching proxies that are aware of RD semantics could be extended to gather information from more than one Resource Directory.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.2">When executing queries, they would consider candidates from all configured upstream servers and report the union of the respective query results.  At this stage, it is highly recommended that content transcoding takes place.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.3">With this approach, many distinct registration URIs can be advertised, for example due to geographic proximity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.p.4">Unlike the other proxying approaches, this helps with the &#8220;large number of registrations&#8221; goal.  If that number is unmanageable for single devices, proxies need not keep full copies of all the RDs&#8217; states but rather send out queries to all of their upstreams, behaving more like the &#8220;plain caching&#8221; proxies.  This multiplies the lookup traffic, but allows for huge numbers of registrations.  The problems of &#8220;too many lookups&#8221; versus &#8220;too many registrations&#8221; can be traded off against each other if the proxies keep parts of the RDs&#8217; states locally at hand while forwarding more exotic requests to all RDs.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.1">This approach also tackles the redundancy goal.  When an endpoint registeres at its RD, the RD updates its endpoint and resource lookup results and includes the registration data until further notice (for correct operation, the &#8220;Lifetime Age&#8221; extension is useful).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.2">If at some point in time that RD server becomes unavailable, the proxies can keep the cached information around.  Before the lifetime expires, the endpoint will attempt to renew its registration and find that the RD is unavailable.  It will then go through discovery again, find the most recently advertised registration URI or pick another one out of a set (see seciton on Recommendations) and start a new registration there.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.3">If the lookup proxies do not evict the old (and soon-to-time-out) registration when the new one on a different RD with the same endpoint name and domain arrives, at worst there will be the same information twice from two registration resources available for lookup.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.12">(This particular server uses multiple ports to tell traffic for different endpoints apart; it could just as well use a catch-all DNS record, do name based virtual hosting and announce <samp>con="coap://reg123.server3.example.com</samp> instead.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.13">The client will then use the discovered address to direct its OSCORE requests to, and the RD server will proxy for it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.14">Note that while this setup <em>can</em> serve as a generic RD and answer resource requests as well, it is doubtful whether there would be any interest in it given the data becomes public, and is limited by the necessity to have an <samp>ep=</samp> filter in all requests lest the network be flooded with requests.</p>
